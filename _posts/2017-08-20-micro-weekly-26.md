Fixed a Meetling
[bug related to block-level function statements](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/73)
causing a blank page in older browsers. Continued with the
[UI tests](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/45), specifying a happy path through the
app and integrating the tests into CI, while maneuvering various browser / web driver quirks. Also
worked on future financing.
