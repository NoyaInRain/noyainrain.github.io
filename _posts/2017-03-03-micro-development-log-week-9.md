title: micro development log - Week 9
---

Managed to finalize two long-standing *Meetling* features, micro Button (which fixes an issue about
[duplicate agenda items](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/32)) and the
[site activity log](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/61). Then finished and released
the [service provider information](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/51) settings.
Submitted a patch to [fix the broken getDate API](https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday/pull/654) of
*Pikaday*, our calendar component. Also concluded the work on further financing for the near future.
