title: micro Weekly 28
---

Finished bringing the dependencies of micro and Listling up-to-date, this week Font Awesome 5 and
ESLint 5. Further experimented on a micro
[location input](https://github.com/noyainrain/micro/issues/28), complementing it with a simple map
component, and explored presenting Listling items with additional location information on a
[map](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/28).
