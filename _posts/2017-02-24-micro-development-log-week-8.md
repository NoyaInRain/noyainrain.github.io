title: micro development log - Week 8
---

This week, like last, was mostly concerned with further financing. Otherwise, put the
internationalization of *Meetling* to hold for now, after rearranging the
[Beta 3 milestone](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/projects/1), which is planned for the
beginning of March. Started to add optional
[service provider information](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/51).
