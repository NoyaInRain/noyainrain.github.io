Finally finished [simple lists](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/1) and with that
released the Listling [MVP](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/projects/1). Also further
experimented on [assigning items](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/3). For micro, added
features that were missing for the MVP: Various
[data binding enhancements](https://github.com/noyainrain/micro/issues/12) and
[form validation handling](https://github.com/noyainrain/micro/issues/13). Furthermore looked into
[keyboard shortcuts]( https://github.com/noyainrain/micro/issues/14) and went on with researching
office spaces in Berlin.
