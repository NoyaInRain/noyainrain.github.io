title: micro Weekly 5
---

Started the next Listling [milestone](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/projects/2) which is
centered around implementing the major list use cases: First off, continuing from the experiments of
last week, worked on
[keyboard navigation / shortcuts](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/9), primarily so
multiple items can be added quickly. Also updated copyright information for both Listling and micro
and looked some more for an office space.
