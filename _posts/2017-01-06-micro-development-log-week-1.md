title: micro development log - Week 1
---

*micro* is a concept for applications I like to call *social micro web apps*, meaning easy-to-use
collaborative web applications that solve a specific problem, do one thing and do it well. *micro*
is also a micro framework to implement such apps (currently part of the
[Meetling source code](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling)).

In 2016, I've been working casually on the first implementation of this concept,
[Meetling](https://meetling.org/), a web app for preparing meetings together. For 2017, I have
arranged the time and necessary resources to focus my work on Meetling development and building
further micro apps. \o/

Every week, from today on, I'll post a short report on the development progress. This is mostly to
help me review the development process, but also for anyone who is interested in the progress of
Meetling and future micro apps.

Let's wrap up with the first report: This week, I started to build
[noyainrain.github.io](https://noyainrain.github.io/), the website featuring this post.
Additionally, I worked on further financing of the project.
