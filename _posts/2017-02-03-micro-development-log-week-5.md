title: micro development log - Week 5
---

Narrowed down the
[internationalization](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/17)
toolchain to Tornado's built-in i18n, i18next and Transifex and started
localizing *Meetling* for English and German. Also, this was yet another week
to work on financing.
