title: micro Weekly 39
---

Carried on with building [simple list](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/1)
functionality for Listling. Finished micro's
[new menu element](https://github.com/noyainrain/micro/issues/5). Implemented
[Watchable](https://github.com/noyainrain/micro/issues/6), a wrapper around an object that can be
watched for modification, which simplifies keeping a list of DOM elements up-to-date. Furthermore
added a [release utility](https://github.com/noyainrain/micro/issues/2) for micro itself and also
worked on future financing.
