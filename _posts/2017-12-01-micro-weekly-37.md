Started to implement the [core list functionality](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/1)
for Listling, amongst other things working on item interaction and trashing / restoring items. Also,
picking up an earlier experiment, added a
[release utility](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/6) and
[fixed the documentation index](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/5).
