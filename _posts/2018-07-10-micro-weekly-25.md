title: micro Weekly 25
---

Continued to fix
[handling of expired push subscriptions](https://github.com/noyainrain/micro/issues/25), introducing
experimental type annotations along the way for the affected code of micro. Also played around with
[real-time content updates](https://github.com/noyainrain/micro/issues/26).

I'll be on vacation next week and development will continue afterwards at full capacity again. ☺️
