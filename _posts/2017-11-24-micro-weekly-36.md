title: micro Weekly 36
---

After the experimentation of the last few weeks, the first prototype of the next micro application
is here: [Listling](https://listling.org) is a service built around collaborative lists, where users
can create and edit lists together. The open source software behind it is called
[Open Listling](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling). Focus of development will onwards shift
from Meetling to Listling, following a new
[roadmap](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/projects/1).

Besides working on the prototype, looked into micro UI components that comprise multiple views.
