title: micro Weekly 40
---

Continued to work on [simple lists](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/1) for Listling
and experimented with [embedding web content](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/7) (like
videos, audio tracks, ...) in items.

Next week I'll be at the [34c3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) and
there will be the opportunity to
[hack on Listling](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Projects:Listling).
Development as usual will continue in January.

Happy new year! ☺️
