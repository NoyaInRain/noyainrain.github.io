Completed the [UI tests](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/45) for Meetling. Started to
apply [client-side linting](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/70), continuing the
experiments of the previous weeks. Experimented with a new message module featuring email and
Telegram communication channels (for notifications). Also again worked on future financing.
