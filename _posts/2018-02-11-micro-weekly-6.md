Continued working on [keyboard navigation](https://github.com/noyainrain/listling/issues/9) for
Listling and started to move [keyboard functionality](https://github.com/noyainrain/micro/issues/14)
over to micro. Also created some [slides introducing Listling](/talks/listling-intro/index.html) and
went on researching office spaces in Berlin.
