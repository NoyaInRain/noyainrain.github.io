Almost completed [extracting micro from Meetling](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/67),
with packaging being the last open task left. micro will be released under a LGPL license.

Development had to be suspended for the last two weeks, due to unforeseen circumstances, and now
continues as planned.
