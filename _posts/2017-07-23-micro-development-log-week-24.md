title: micro development log - Week 24
---

Removed deprecated code from Meetling. Further continued to experiment with
[client-side linting](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/70).

For my last week at bexio, followed by a week of vacation, micro development will be suspended and
continue afterwards afresh at full capacity.
