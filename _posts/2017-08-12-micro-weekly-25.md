title: micro Weekly 25
---

Included the [title and date in meeting URLs](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/66), so
shared Meetling links are more identifiable. Started to add
[UI tests](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/45) (end-to-end tests), picking up an
earlier experimental branch. Also continued to explore
[client-side linting](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/70) and invested some time in
future financing.

From now on, this development log goes by the (less bulky) name *micro Weekly*.
