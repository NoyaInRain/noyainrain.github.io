title: micro development log - Week 4
---

Started with the [internationalization](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/17) of
*Meetling*, mainly evaluating libraries and tooling. Made *noyainrain.github.io* pages shareable and
added a news feed. Revisited the
[patch to relax the required Ruby version](https://github.com/helpyio/helpy/pull/339) of *Helpy*,
the software behind [meetling.org Feedback](https://feedback.meetling.org/). Also continued to work
on further financing.
