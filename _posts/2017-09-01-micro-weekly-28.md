Completed cleaning up the code base after enabling
[client-side linting](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/70) for Meetling. Started to
[split micro into a stand-alone project](https://github.com/noyainrain/meetling/issues/67),
continuing a former experimental branch. Besides experimented with the mentioned message module and
engaged in future financing.

The next two weeks I'll be on vacation in Italy and development will continue afterwards as planned.
